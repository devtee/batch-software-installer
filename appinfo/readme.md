- program.reg

* program-install.txt - this sets the variables needed to install the program, check if it is installed and how to find the latest to check online 
* program-uninstall.txt - this sets the variable neeed to uninstall the program.
* program.reg - this is a registry file to set a DisplayVersion in case the installer doesn't do this.
